Nothing but books.\n\nBut as Amazon grew, Bezos relied on two reliable tactics to expand:\n\n1️⃣ Feed Customer Need\n\n→ Amazon built the Kindle when their customers told them they wanted ebooks.\n\nAmazon weren’t a tech company, they had no hardware or team, so they built one. Because the customer told them that’s what they wanted it.\n\n2️⃣ Use Your Skills To Build Forward \n\n→ Amazon launched AWS (Amazon web solutions) by leveraging the world-class distribution system they built for their books. Allowing them to grow and deliver products from other categories.\n\nAnd step by step, those tactics scaled Amazon from books → music → video → cloud computing → global dominance.\n\nBezos’ advice to founders? \n\nEither expand from customer needs or from your strengths.
